      Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?<br />
      And how much can I be expected to tolerate?<br />
      So I started to think about the plans I made<br />
      The debt unpaid<br />
      And you just can't call a spade a spade<br />
      I watch the moon<br />
      Let it run my mood<br />
      Can't stop thinking of you<br />
      I watch you (now I let it go)<br />
      (And I watch as things play out like)<br />
      So long, nice to know you, I'll be moving on<br />
      We started off in such a nice place<br />
      We were talking the same language<br />
      I o-open and I'm closing<br />
      You can't stand the thought<br />
      Of a real beating heart<br />
      You'd be holding, having trouble<br />
      O-o-owning and admit that<br />
      I am hoping<br />
      I watch the moon<br />
      Let it run my mood<br />
      Can't stop thinking of you<br />
      I watch you (now I let it go)<br />
      (And I watch as things play out like)<br />
      So long, nice to know you, I'll be moving on<br />
      Moving on<br />
      You<br />
      Yeah, I always know the truth<br />
      But I can't just say it to you<br />
      Yeah, I know the truth<br />
      I knew<br />
      Yeah, I always know the truth<br />
      But I can't just say it to you<br />
      Yeah, I know the truth<br />
      I never thought we'd see it through<br />
      I never could rely on you<br />
      And few times your face came into view<br />
      Into view<br />
      I'm not into you<br />
      Into you<br />
