    <p>
      Briefly, the best use case is to add animation between transitions for certain web pages, and apps can be a plus.
      Being more specific:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Static webs like landing pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        For SPAs, transitions between components' states.
      </li>
      <li>
        Web frameworks using a native API instead of an in-house solution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A huge drawback (aside from not being compatible with Mozilla-based browsers) is that it requires the user to have
      a good connection, accessibility features like preferred-reduced-motion should be taken care of by creating a
      custom animation for it, and it is still an API in development and requires time for extended adoption.
